# LEAD SCORING CASE STUDY UPGRAD

## Problem Statement
1. X Education, an online education company, offers courses to industry
professionals. Each day, numerous professionals interested in these courses visit
the website to browse. After filling out a form on the website, individuals are
classified as leads by the company.
2. After acquiring these leads, the sales team begins contacting them through phone
calls, emails, and other methods. While some leads convert into customers, the
majority do not.
3. X Educationâ€™s typical lead conversion rate is around 30%. This means that if they
acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 are converted into customers. To
improve efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads,
referred to as "Hot Leads".
4. By successfully identifying this group of leads, the conversion rate is expected to
increase, as the sales team will be able to concentrate their efforts on engaging with
high-potential leads instead of reaching out to everyone.

## Business Objective

1. Lead X has tasked us with developing a model that assigns each lead a score
between 0 and 100. This scoring system will help them identify Hot Leads,
allowing them to focus on these high-potential prospects and improve their
conversion rate.
2. The CEO aims to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%.
3. They want the model to be adaptable to future challenges, such as managing
actions during peak times, optimizing the use of the full workforce, and
determining the best approaches after the target has been reached.
